# This Planet Sucks

A space-building game I'm making on my break from gamdev. Not really anything yet.

Also it requires a modified version of Godot 4 because I just can't help myself. I hijacked the normal buffer to give me the albedo for ambient light from the atmosphere.
The game's playable with stock Godot 4, but everything will be colored weird.

The specific branch of Godot is here: https://github.com/needleful/godot/tree/planet_game
